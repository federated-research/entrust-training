# Overview

Welcome to this online resource, which aims to provide training material for **TRE Administrators**, around **Federated Workflow Processing**.

---

The material presented here should help readers to:

- understand the **concepts** and **standards** used for Federated Workflow Processing
- deploy and configure the **Five Safes TES** tooling used for the EOSC-ENTRUST **Second Deployable Demonstrator of Digital Objects and Workflows**.
- understand what **analyses** could be performed in a TRE within a federated context, subject to:
  - what the TRE finds acceptable
  - the capabilities of the tools in use (such as, but not limited to, the Five Safes TES tooling)

---

This page gives an overview of the material as a project deliverable for [EOSC-ENTRUST](#eosc-entrust), for which it was developed.

## Deliverable D20.2 [#deliverable]

This resource forms the EOSC-ENTRUST **First Training Package** for **Digital Objects and Workflows**, which is a project deliverable for EOSC-ENTRUST [**Work Package 20**](#wp20).

The deliverable (D20.2) is described by the project as "An online resource explaining how to deploy workflows via the new TRE tooling",
and as such is provided as a website primarily targeting TRE Administrators in order for them to understand the "new TRE tooling" (Five Safes TES), along with how to deploy it, how to deploy workflows on it, and what analyses can reasonably be deployed.

There is an accompanying deliverable document which gives further context to the material herein, as well as its development, which will be linked once published.

## Work Package 20 [#wp20]

This material was produced by Work Package 20 for the [EOSC-ENTRUST](#eosc-entrust) Project.

Work Package 20 -- **RO-Crate and workflow processing - Deployment** -- is a second year project work package and continues the work of the first year's Work Package 19 -- RO-Crate and workflow processing - Establishing a common
terminology and approach.

The focus of Work Package 20 is on deployment of tooling to demonstrate usage of RO-Crates and Workflow Processing, within the context of the EOSC-ENTRUST TRE Blueprint for Federation.
This is in part achieved through the related deliverables work package deliverables:

- **D20.1** - Deployable Demonstrator of Digital Objects & Workflows Developments, Second Version
- **D20.2** - Training package for Digital Objects & Workflows

## The EOSC-ENTRUST Project [#eosc-entrust]

[EOSC-ENTRUST](https://www.eosc-entrust.eu) aims to create a European network of Trusted Research Environments (TREs) for sensitive data and drive European interoperability by joint development of a common blueprint for federated data access and analysis.
