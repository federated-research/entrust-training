# Analysis Types for TREs

There are a number of factors which affect what analysis can be performed firstly within a TRE and secondly when federating that analysis.

The [Federated Research Patterns](https://docs.federated-analytics.ac.uk/federated_research_patterns/patterns) as referred to in [Concepts & Standards](concepts) help with communication of these factors and their impact.

Factors affecting Analytical Patterns include:

- The type of analysis (typically determined by the algorithm(s) in use, not the desired statistics)
- How that analysis will be initiated
- What data movement is required to achieve the analysis
- What data egress would occur

Additonally, all of the above must be considered in the context of the approach to federation of analysis and the capability of the tools implementing that approach.

TREs must find the above factors acceptable within their own governance frameworks and processes in order for analysis to be achievable.

## An interactive illustration

To help TREs understand the impact of their acceptance of these factors on what analysis may be achievable, we have developed as part of EOSC-ENTRUST the following resource:

<Cards.Card
  className="mt-4"
  icon={<ChevronRightCircleIcon />}
  title="Analysis Types for TREs"
  href="https://health-informatics-uon.github.io/analysis-types-for-TREs/"
/>

The site contains a description of [Categories of Analysis methods](https://health-informatics-uon.github.io/analysis-types-for-TREs/Categorisation), and its approach to that categorisation (determined by the factors detailed above).

It also provides an interactive resource that, using the categories, allows the user to [get achievable analyses by their acceptance requirements](https://health-informatics-uon.github.io/analysis-types-for-TREs/analysis-breakdown).
