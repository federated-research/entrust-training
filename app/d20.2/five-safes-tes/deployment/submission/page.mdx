# Deploying Submission Components

The Submission Layer consists of the **Submission API** and **UI** components, along with some supporting components, such as **KeyCloak** and **MinIO**.

It is straight forward to run all the Submission Layer components on a single Virtual Machine via Docker Compose.

> [!TIP]
>
> Some of the components may be fulfilled by existing services, such as an existing KeyCloak or MinIO installation; these can be omitted from the Compose file used for deployment, and the environment settings changed to point at the existing services.
