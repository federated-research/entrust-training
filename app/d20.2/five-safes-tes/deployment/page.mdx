# Deploying the Five Safes TES Tools

There are quite a few components that make up the Five Safes TES Tools, but there are some common things to consider when deploying the tools.

Firstly, all the components except the TES Backend are available as OCI Container Images, and the deployment samples use Docker Compose.

The TES Backend is the installer's choice, and is expected to be deployed separately, but network-available to the other Five Safes TES TRE Layer components.

Finally, it is up to the installer how they distribute the installation of the components, though the guidance and samples here refer to separate environments for:

- Submission
- Each TRE's components except TES (Agent, Egress, Storage, Auth, etc.)
- Each TRE's TES Backend

## Requirements

Given the above there are some requirements for deployment, which are covered in each deployment guide.
