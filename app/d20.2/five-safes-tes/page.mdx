# Five Safes TES Tools

The Five Safes TES Tools are an open-source reference implementation of the [Five Safes TES Weave](https://docs.federated-analytics.ac.uk/five_safes_tes) for Federated Research.

## Core Components Summary

The Five Safes TES Documentation provides an overview of the Tools' [Core Components](https://docs.federated-analytics.ac.uk/five_safes_tes/reference_implementation/core_components), in the context of a demonstration deployment.

To summarise:

- A Federation of TREs would have a centralised Submission Service: the **Five Safes TES Submission Layer**
  - It connects to a **KeyCloak** server to provide OIDC Authentication, similar to EOSC-ENTRUST AAAI
  - It connects to a **MinIO** server to function as Artifact Storage
- Each TRE in the Federation would have:
  - A **Five Safes TES TRE Agent**
  - A **Five Safes TES Egress Portal**
  - A **GA4GH TES Backend**, such as [Funnel](https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/)
  - A **MinIO** server to function as task storage between the above components
  - A **KeyCloak** server to provide OIDC Authentication for all the above components
