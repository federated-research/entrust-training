# Training Package Audience

As described in the [overview](/d20.2), this training package has been developed primarily with **TRE Administrators** in mind.

However, there are adjacent audiences for whom some of the referenced material is relevant, discussed below.

Since this resource presents its content through a lens for TRE Administrators, there is also value in clarifying the roles considered to be performed within the label of "TRE Administrator".

## Relevant audiences

- **Federation Administrators**, people responsible for co-ordinating a Federation of TREs
  - For the purposes of this training package, this would include managing the configuration of Projects and their TRE and User memberships in a Federation-centralised Submission Service
  - This role may be performed by a TRE Administrator, e.g. within the "Front Door" TRE of a Federation, and as such is within the scope of this training package for TRE Administrators.
- **TRE Administrators**, people responsible for managing and operating a TRE.
  - The material covers different aspects of TRE Administration that may be handled by different roles:
    - **Installers**, responsible for deploying and configuring the technical infrastructure and tools
    - **Administrators**, responsible for managing projects within the TRE
      - In the context of this training package and Five Safes TES, TRE Administrators will interact with the deployed tooling
    - **Output Controllers**, responsible for approving or rejecting project outputs for egress from the TRE.
- **Researchers**, people who want to submit analyses to TREs within a Federation in which they are an approved member of a Project, using this tooling.
  - This training package does not focus on this audience, however some Researcher activities are described within the material, to provide TRE Administrators with context and understanding of the process from a Researcher's perspective:
    - How to submit and run analyses
    - How to retrieve approved outputs.
